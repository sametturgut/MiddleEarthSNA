This is an SNA (Social Network Analysis) project about J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle Earth characters. The character matrix consists LOTR, Hobbit, and The Silmarillion characters. Some characters may be missing by mistake, and others may be missing intentionally to prevent the project's exponential growth. This project basically tells which characters interacted with which characters. (If a character is a direct descendant of another character, I presumed their interaction directly even if it is not mentioned in the books.) It took weeks to create the character matrix, but this project needed more time and dedication. Surely, you can find mistakes in the character matrix, but you can improve this character matrix if you are dedicated enough.
